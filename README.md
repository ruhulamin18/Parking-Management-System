# 🅿️ Parking Management System

A Java-based console application designed to efficiently manage parking slots and registered members using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project simulates a real-world parking system and ensures proper space allocation, secure vehicle tracking, and an interactive user experience via the console.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The Parking Management System streamlines the parking process by automating member registration, car parking and removal, and slot tracking. The project emphasizes clean, modular code through the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and other core OOP concepts. It's ideal for understanding how software design maps to real-life systems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement an automated parking solution using Java and OOP.
- Allow only registered members to park vehicles.
- Track available and occupied slots in real-time.
- Prevent duplicate registrations and unauthorized parking.
- Provide a smooth, error-free user experience through console interaction.

## 🧰 Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Member Registration       | Register users with name and license number                |
| Car Parking               | Allow registered users to park if a slot is available      |
| Car Removal               | Remove a car from the lot                                  |
| View Parked Cars          | Display currently parked vehicles                          |
| View Available Slots      | Show how many parking slots are open                       |
| View Registered Members   | Display all members who have registered                    |
| Error Handling            | Prevents invalid inputs, duplicate entries, and misuse     |

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The system stores member and vehicle data using `ArrayList`s.
- A menu-driven console interface guides users through each operation.
- Only registered users can park or remove vehicles.
- Parking slots are automatically tracked and updated upon actions.
- The system handles exceptions like duplicate registration or invalid actions.

## 📈 Performance

- **Fast execution** with optimized in-memory data structures.
- **Secure operations** through member validation.
- **Accurate slot tracking** using logical conditions and arrays/lists.
- **Easy to maintain** due to modular class-based structure.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Add a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for improved usability.
- Integrate with a **Database** to persist member and vehicle records.
- Implement **Multi-threading** to support multiple users simultaneously.
- Enable **Remote Access** via web or mobile platforms.
- Add **Timed Parking** or billing functionality.
